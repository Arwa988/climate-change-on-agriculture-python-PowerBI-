## Project Idea :
Many Countries suffer from lack in the  agriculture in some crop types due to unsuitable climate weather or lack of soil needs , so countries  have to import these crops that costs it economically . 
so we have to know the needed conditions for each crop to provide it rather than buying it from other countries
## Tools used :
- Python for data exploration and preprocessing
- PowerBI for data visualization
## Dashboard:

## Insights:
-  all crop types  has a great crop yield at moderate Temperature from 15 C to 25 C
-  all crop types  has a great crop yield at low Precipitation , so crops are too sensitive to floods and heavy rains
-  Every Crop type has its own Fertilizer and pesticide percentage need so we have to know each
## Recommendation :
-We can use greenhouses that maintain ideal temperature by isolating plant from external weather.
-we can use Sensors that monitor the plant needs as Fertilizer , pesticide and  water level 
-We can use Machine Learning models that predict the weather conditions in order to be ready for any extreme weather conditions
