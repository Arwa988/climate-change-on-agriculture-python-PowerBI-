## Project Idea :
Many Countries suffer from lack in the  agriculture in some crop types due to unsuitable climate weather or lack of soil needs , so countries  have to import these crops that costs it economically . 
so we have to know the needed conditions for each crop to provide it rather than buying it from other countries
## Tools used :
- Python for data exploration and preprocessing
- PowerBI for data visualization
